        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a lifelong student of the world, always ready to gain knowledge about this world we lived in, especially in Science and Engineering. 
            Hence, I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Product Development from Singapore University of Technology and Design, then a Master of Science in Statistics and Data Science from Leiden University.
            <br>A critical thinker with a strong foundation in scientific and engineering principles, I approach problems from varied perspectives to develop innovative solutions. 
            I am currently advancing my practical skills in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science, with a focus on data-driven modelling and real-world application. 
            Being passionate about emerging technologies, I remain committed to continuous learning in high-impact, interdisciplinary domains.
